# Google Stock Price Prediction

In the realm of finance, predicting stock prices is an ongoing challenge. In this project, we focus on Google's stock price prediction using advanced Time Series Prediction techniques, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

This project revolves around:

1. The Challenge: Predicting stock prices is complex due to numerous influencing factors. Time Series Prediction methods, particularly RNN LSTM, offer a powerful approach by considering the sequential nature of financial data.

2. RNN LSTM: We employ RNN LSTM, known for capturing long-range dependencies and retaining past information, making it ideal for forecasting financial time series data.

4. Objectives: Our goal is to create a robust stock price prediction model for Google, providing a valuable tool for decision-making in financial markets.

In this project, we delve into data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to unlock insights into Google's stock price movements.
